# TinyGP
This repository contains the Java implementation on TinyGP by Riccardo Poli as found in the textbook ["A field guide to genetic programming"](http://gpbib.cs.ucl.ac.uk/cache/cache/.hidden_13-jun_578559275/http___dces.essex.ac.uk_staff_rpoli_gp-field-guide_A_Field_Guide_to_Genetic_Programming.pdf) by [Poli](https://www.essex.ac.uk/people/polir15101/riccardo-poli), [Langdon](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/W.Langdon/) and [McPhee](https://csci.williams.edu/nic-mcphee/).

To run the code, first compile the code by running on your favourite terminal emulator:

`javac -0 tiny_gp.java` 

(Java > 8 will be more than sufficient). You can then run the code with:

`java tiny_gp YOUR_FAV_SEED FILEPATH`

e.g. for the Sine example, run:

`java tiny_gp 42 data/sin-data.txt`  

Have many funs :grinning:
